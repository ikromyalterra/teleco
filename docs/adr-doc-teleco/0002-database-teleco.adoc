= [ADR-0002] Database

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Bahtiar Indra Ariyanki
* Date: 2021-08-30

== Summary

=== Issue

We need to choose database for our back-end engine. The highest transaction per minute (tpm) in BPA for the last 7 month for telco product prepaid is around 900 tpm, so wee need to handle this high transaction.

=== Decision

We are choosing MongoDB for the database. 

Why MongoDB:

* Support unstructured data, JSON Format Document, and easy to use.
* We only need to read configuration and store transaction log.
* Mature, popular Database, and have a good performance.

=== Consequences

We don't have experience using mongodb for high transaction. Need to discuss more with infrastructure team.
